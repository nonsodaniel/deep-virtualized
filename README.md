In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

# Experience

My experience creating this solution was a bitter-sweet one, because of the fact that I created something slightly different from the requirement.
I created a Scrollable list with `Sorting and Searching` functionalities as opposed creating a Virtualized List.
As a result of time-constraint, I wasn't able to bring out the best of the Virtualized List but ended up creating a very basic implementation which I'm not satisfied with.

## What would you have done better?

Enhance the style of the list and list items, add `Sort and Search` functionalities and make sure it's 100% Bug-free.

## Challenges faced

Encountered some challenges with `React-testing-library` setup, and also the `Redux store configuration`. My biggest challenge was mistakenly working on a different implementation initially which reduced the time I had left to work on the actual implementation.
